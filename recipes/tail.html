    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Honey glazed slowpoke tail served with punchy blueberry and walnut mix</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Slowpoke Tail</li>
        <li>Wild Honey</li>
        <li>Maple Syrup</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Blueberries</li>
        <li>Walnuts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put Slowpoke tail on a paper plate, then drizzle honey and maple syrup on it. Sprinkle salt onto it. (Remember, Slowpoke like the sea)</li>
        <li>Heat the plate in the microwave for one minute. There will likely be a few pops if you have bacon. What this does is it better infuses the meat with the two, and makes the two blend into a very sap-like blend. (Which is what Slowpoke tails are known for having)</li>
        <li>Drizzle with more honey</li>
        <li>Serve with crushed blueberries and walnuts</li>
    </ol>
