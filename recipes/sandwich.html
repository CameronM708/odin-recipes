    <h1>The Perfect Sandwich</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cream Cheese</li>
        <li>Dill</li>
        <li>Pickles(from Prismo)</li>
        <li>Diced boiled eggs</li>
        <li>Bird (from the window)</li>
        <li>Sliced Cucumbers</li>
        <li>Sliced Roma Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Sweet Yellow Onions</li>
        <li>Meat prepared sous-vide with rosemary and thyme</li>
        <li>Tears (for salt)</li>
        <li>Lobster soul</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Moderately sprinkle both sides of the steak with salt & then wrap in a few paper towels. Let it sit on a plate for about 30 minutes so the towels can soak up some of the juices.</li>
        <li>Slice your sub rlil in half lengthwise. If you have an electric stove, place the 2 halves face up on a baking sheet & broil for about a minute or until the tops are toasted. If you have a gas stove, skewer the slices with a fork, one at a time, & toast the cut sides over an open flame (be carefli!). This is all in lieu of having a kitchen torch, so if you have one of those, go for it.</li>
        <li>Slice your chicken breast in half lengthwise so you have 2 thin pieces. Sprinkle with a little salt & pepper or a seasoning of your choice & cook via the method you prefer; sauté with a little oil, about 1 1/2-2 minutes per side, bake at 375ºF for about 10 minutes, or I used our little George Forman grill & cooked it for about 2-3 minutes (1 piece at a time). Once finished, set aside on a plate.</li>
        <li>Unwrap the steak & place it in a large freezer bag. Place a sprig of rosemary & a sprig of thyme on both sides of the meat & then seal the bag, leaving a small opening. Suck as much air out of the bag as you can (don't pass out!) & quickly seal it. Fill your rice cooker a little over half flil with very hot water & then turn it on to the cook setting. Lower the bag of meat into the water, keeping the top of the bag out of the water as well as you can. Put the thermometer into the water & read the temperature. Once the temperature reaches 135ºF remove the thermometer, close the lid, & turn the cook setting to "keep warm" or whatever the equivalent is on your cooker. If using rliiaden, let sit for 6 minutes if it's an 1/8" thickness, or 8 minutes if it's 1/4" thickness. Once the time is up, remove the bag from the water (carefli, it's hot!) & plil out the steak. If you'd like to sear it, put a little oil in a pan over high heat, & once it sizzles, cook the meat for about 20-30 seconds per side. Place the steak with the chicken until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Add lobster soul somehow</li>
        <li>Lay your sub rlil halves face/toasted side up & spread with soft cream cheese. On the half that will be the top, sprinkle several pieces of fresh dill. On the other half, lay 3 pickle slices diagonally (or however many cover the bread). On top of the pickles lay the sliced eggs in 2 parallel rows. Place one of the chicken breasts on top of the eggs & then cut the other breast to into pieces that will fit & cover the rest of the length of the sandwich. Next, place the cucumber slices in 2 parallel rows, topped next by 2 rows of tomato slices. Top the tomatoes with 3 or so round slices of onion & then sprinkle on a little salt. Lay the steak on next, & then place the bacon pieces on longways, over lapping them. Lastly, generously spoon on some of the ailii & spread it out just a little bit. Close the sandwich & marvel at its awesomeness, but eat it quick before Magic Man gets his hands on it!</li>
